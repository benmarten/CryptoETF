## Settings
The tool expects your settings in settings.json. Take a look at settings.example.json for a starting point.
- *accounts*: Under accounts, fill in your api credentials for the exchange that you want to use. Delete the exchanges that you do not need.
- *symbolMapping*: Some exchanges use different symbols that coinmarketcap.com. Hence here you can map the symbols, e.g.: map MIOTA to IOTA.
- *otherHoldings*: A place to manually add some of your holdings. Notation is key: Symbol, value is amount of native currency.
- *options*: These are specific options for the tool:
  - targetValueUsd: The target value for your ETF; A general rule of thumb is to keep your crypto at a certain percentage of your overall investment portfolio. This could be 5, 10, 20 or more percent, depending on your risk tolerance.
    - Default [false]: Use current portfolio value as target value.
    - Number [1 - 999999999999]: Use fixed number as target value.
  - rebalanceDeltaTotalPct: Treshold in percent, that will show a Y in the rebalance column, once rebalancing of total portfolio is recommended.
  - rebalanceDeltaPct: Treshold in percent, that will show a Y in the rebalance column, once rebalancing of individual position is recommended.
  - minValueBtc: Ignore coins that only have a holdingsvalue under a certain bitcoin value.
  - exchangeMinValueBtc: Don't list exchanges in the exchanges column, with less than the specified BTC value. The complete holding value will still be added in the total sum.
  - hideMissingCoins: By default CryptoETF will add all missing coins up to your last coin holding by rank of the coin (global market cap). This option disables that behaviour.
- *outputFile*: Path to a file to forward the output to as json.
